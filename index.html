<h2>Pros and Cons of Current Dashboards:</h2>
<p> Subaru Dashboard: The Subaru dashboard is designed fairy well. It is relatively simple with the only gauges being a speedometer, tachometer, and fuel gauge. Other than that, there are the common signals on the dash. The only issue that I have with this design is the location of the signals. There doesn’t seem to be much of a pattern or reason for the grouping of the signals. For example the brake light is separated from the Antilock Braking System(ABS) light; this could be improved. Furthermore, this dashboard does not have an engine coolant temperature gauge.
    <br/>
     <br/>
    Audi Dashboard: The Audi dashboard is a newer sleeker dashboard compared to most. It has a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and engine coolant temperature gauge. I believe these components make up the bare minimum for a dashboard. The dash contains a few signals but mainly displays information about the car with a screen. This screen contains most signal lights as well as a map. I like this display, but I believe the screen is unnecessary. I also think it’s possible that the screen could become too crowded trying to display all of the information. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4Runner Dashboard: This is the dashboard of my personal car, and one of my top picks for my favorite dashboard. It has the four gauges that are essential to have; a tachometer, speedometer, fuel gauge, and engine coolant temperature gauge. It has a simple screen that can display the odometer and also has the signals intuitively placed. The signal lights are together under the speedometer, where your primary focus will be. The lights that come on for most engine issues are by the tachometer and the other lights that are less important or more related to software issues or 4 wheel drive being on or off is by the fuel gauge. However, while there is some sort of pattern for the signal grouping, I feel like it could be improved.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Camry Dashboard: This dashboard has a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and a gauge that tells you how many miles to the gallon you’re getting. It also has two screen displays that show the gear you’re in, the coolant temperature, the odometer, and, unlike the other dashboards, the outside temperature. Other than that it has the standard signals kind of scattered about the dash. I like this one because it is very aesthetically pleasing and symmetrical. However, I do believe that the average miles per gallon gauge isn’t needed and could be shown on one of the screen displays easier.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Honda Civic Dashboard: The Honda Civic dashboard is my top favorite out of the five due to simplicity. It has the four necessary gauges and the signals aren’t randomly placed around the dashboard; they are grouped together. Since, not all of them will be on at the same time, hopefully, you know where to expect all of the signals to show up without it being crowded. The one thing that should be added is a cruise control signal and possibly combining the outside temperature with the odometer.

<h2>Common & Uncommon Features:</h2>
<p>
The most common features of a dashboard are the blinkers, headlights, tachometer, speedometer and the odometer. Some other rare features of a dashboard would be 4-wheel drive indicators if the car has them.
</p>
<h2>Interactive Features</h2>
<p>
    The only features that would be user interactive on the dashboard would be the lights, blinkers, emergency signal and cruise control. The others only come on if there is some issue that is caused from simply driving the vehicle.
   </p>
<h2>Common Mistakes:</h2>
<p>A mistake that could be made with the Honda Civic dashboard is the fact that the tachometer does not specify that the units are in RPM’s which could be confusing. The Audi and the Subaru do not have an arrow for the fuel signal, so the driver won’t know what side of the car the gas cap is on. The 4Runner and the Camry dashboard designs are good but I think signal placement could be improved.
</p>
<h2>Improvements:</h2>
<p>Some improvements that I would make pertain to the placement of the signals. I would place the engine warning light by the engine temperature gauge and the low fuel indicator by the fuel gauge. Other than that, I believe the typical gauge and signal placements are okay. Another improvement I would make is to put, for the most part all signals in a general locations so they are not spread out all over the dashboard.</p>
