<h2>Issue with current interface:</h2>
<p> a). One issue with this interface is if you click 1, the microwave will start heating up for 1 minute. If you click 2, however, the microwave will not add 2 
    more minutes it will keep the 1.
    <br/>
     <br/>
    b). There are a variety of buttons like, reheat, defrost, etc. that could potentially be useful but remain unused because they are uneeded. For example, why does one need a
    reheat button on a microwave? Isn't the purpose of a microwave to reheat food? I think the interface should be very simple with 
    only efficeint buttons to heat up the food. The more buttons, the more crowded the interface seems.
   </p>
<h2>Common Uses:</h2>
<p>
    a). The most common use I have is heating up food by just clicking a number for the amount of minutes I want to cook my meal.
      <br/>
      <br/>
    b). Another common use is the "Add 30" seconds button that either starts the microwave for 30 seconds or adds 30 seconds to the current cook time.</p>

<h2>Uncommon Uses:</h2>
<p>a). A more uncommomn use is the "popcorn" button on the interface. I click it whenever I have popcorn but most of the time it only cooks half the bag and leaves the rest kernels. This means I have to add more time anyways.
  <br/>
      <br/>
    b). I also use the "defrost" button whenever I need to defrost food. Once again, I typically end up needing to run the frozen food through one or two defrost cycles before it actually thaws out.</p>
<h2>How the Interface Helps:</h2>
<p>The current interface does help with some common uses with functions like add 30 seconds and whenever you click a number it starts for that amount of minutes. These  
    features can be helpful in that it lets you avoid clicking the start button or messing with a specific amount of seconds. Its just one button and your food starts
    heating up. </p>
<h2>Common Sequence of Actions:</h2>
<p>A common sequence of actions is typically putting food in the microwave and clicking the number for how many minutes I want the food to cook. If I want my food to
    cook a little longer than what I initially put it in for, I click the add 30 seconds button.
    </p>
<h2>How the Microwave Helps, Hurts, and Gives Feedback:</h2>
<p>The current interface on the microwave supports the user by having key words indicating what that button might do. It also supports the user by only having a handle 
    to open and close the door. This way it is very clear that the only way to open the door is to pull the handle and obviously the only way to close it is to push it 
    closed. On the downside, many of the buttons such as the "popcorn," "defrost," "reheat," etc. are not very helpful because, from personal experience, they do not 
    achieve their intended purpose; they typically over or under heat the food. However, despite its flaws, it is fairly simple to figure out how the microwave works by
    trial and error. For example, you can click the defrost button and on the tiny screen it will display how long its going to heat up the food and at what power level 
    its running on. For feedback, everytime you click a button on the microwave it will beep. It will also give a unique beep when its done cooking.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes:</h2>
<p>A common mistake I have seen from guests using the microwave is clicking a number, and then clicking another one thinking that it will add those minutes to the current cook time.</p>
    
<h2>New Microwave Interface: </h2>
<img src="Images/MyMicrowave.png" Width = 500/>
<p>For my design I have made a simple and efficient microwave interface. I believe a microwave should have the minimal amount of buttons possible so
   I implemented a simple keypad, a start button, which is also an add 30 seconds button, a door control, a cancel button, and lastly a time cook button that
   allows the user to cook for a specific number of seconds. The cook time is helpful because by default, if a number is clicked it will start the microwave 
   for that many minutes. Furthermore, while the microwave is running, you can click any of the numbers to add more minutes or click the start button to add 30 seconds.
   As for user feedback, the only feedback given is the amount of time the microwave is running which is displayed on the screen.</p>
